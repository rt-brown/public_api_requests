# Public_API_Requests
This project is focused on the skills it takes to fetch data from an api and manipulate and display in the front end.

## Usage
This app fetchs data from `randomuser.me` which is an api that returns fake user data in JSON form. A `checkStatus` function has been implemented to help update the front end letting the user know an error has occurred. 

Once the app recieves data it then populates the DOM with that data by accessing the json data and using template literals. Once the initial data is recevied the app then adds click event to the cards to display modals.
